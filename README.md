<h1>Machine Learning: Hot Beverage Preference</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on predicting an individualâ€™s hot beverage preference based on various features such as demographics, lifestyle, and habits. The dataset includes information about 1,500 people. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and supervised and unsupervised learning.
<br />

<h2>Technologies</h2>
  <p>- Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn</p>
  <p>- Jupyter Notebook</p>
 
<h2>Dataset</h2>
   <p>- The dataset includes attributes such as ID, name, pronoun, weight, pets, and daily habits (e.g., water intake, commute time). The target variable is the individual's preferred hot beverage.</p>

<h2>Project Steps</h2>
<p>1. Data Cleaning & EDA: Initial dataset analysis and cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing data).</p>
<p>2. Clustering: Performed K-means clustering to understand patterns.</p>
<p>3. Classification: Trained multiple classifiers, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine to predict the target.</p>
<p>4. Visualization: Used visualizations such as histograms, bar graphs, and confusion matrices to analyze the results.</p>
